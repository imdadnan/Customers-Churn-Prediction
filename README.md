# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem in the banking sector. This project analyzes bank customer data to identify why customers leave and builds a Logistic Regression model to predict churn.

The goal is to provide clear business insights along with a simple and explainable machine learning model that can help banks improve customer retention.
